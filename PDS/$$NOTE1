Sam,
As time permits, I am going through some old stuff before it gets
deleted for good.  This is one more oldie.  There were a number
of times that I wanted to trace the flow of execution of a
program.  I have used WTOs, printed messages, and caused abends
(usually by zapping an opcode to zeros).

One thing I came up with was this macro.  You replace the "EQU *"
or "DS 0H" that are usually used for generating labels with this
LABEL macro.  You can turn the tracing on and off at various
points by coding "LABEL TRACE=ON" or "LABEL TRACE=OFF".
Somewhere in the program you need to code "LABEL TRACE=ROUTINE".
The trace routine obtains some storage and then inserts the label
coded on the LABEL macros in a wrap-around table.  Once the
program is working, if code "LABEL TRACE=OFF" at the beginning of
the source, the MACRO only generates a "DS 0H" so there is zero
overhead.
